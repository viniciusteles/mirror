"""Extraction eval: memory extraction quality on canned conversation transcripts.

Each probe calls extract_memories() against a fixed transcript and checks
whether the output satisfies an expected shape.

Run with:
    uv run python -m memory eval extraction

Requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY. Costs a few cents per run.
