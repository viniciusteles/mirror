"""Routing eval: persona detection behavioral contract on canned queries.

Tests detect_persona() against fixed queries. Documents which messages should
route where — clear domain cases, ambiguous inputs, and null cases.

Today detect_persona() is keyword-based (deterministic, free to run). This eval
lives in evals/ rather than tests/ because CV7.E2 will replace keyword routing
with an LLM classifier; these fixtures become the regression net at that point.

Run with:
    uv run python -m memory eval routing

Requires a seeded database with persona routing metadata. Free to run — no LLM calls.
