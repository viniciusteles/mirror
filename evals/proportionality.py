"""Proportionality eval: extraction should produce zero memories for trivial exchanges.

This is the watch probe described in draft-analysis.md §8.1. Short, casual,
lived-in messages should not produce memories. If this eval fails consistently,
the expression pass earns its way back into scope as focused CV8 work.

Run with:
    uv run python -m memory eval proportionality

Requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY. Costs a few cents per run.
