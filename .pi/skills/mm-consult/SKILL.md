# Consult

Sends prompts with Mirror identity context to other models through OpenRouter.

## Syntax

```
/mm-consult <family> [tier] ["question"]
/mm-consult credits
```

- **family:** `gemini`, `grok`, `deepseek`, `openai`, `claude`, `llama`, or a direct model ID
- **tier:** `lite` (default), `mid`, `flagship`
- **question present:** send it directly
- **question missing:** synthesize the current conversation and create the prompt

## Flow

### Explicit Question

Analyze the message to determine persona and journey using Mirror routing.

```bash
uv run python -m memory consult FAMILY TIER "QUESTION" \
  [--persona PERSONA] [--journey JOURNEY] [--org]
```

**Examples:**
- `/mm-consult gemini lite "draft an opening for this article"` → `uv run python -m memory consult gemini lite "draft an opening for this article" --persona writer`
- `/mm-consult deepseek "is this design overengineered?"` → `uv run python -m memory consult deepseek "is this design overengineered?" --persona engineer`

The script prints the response, cost, and balance. Always show the complete response to the user without summarizing or omitting it.

### No Question

When the user omits the question, synthesize Mirror Mode content (reflection, strategy, content — not Builder Mode code or architecture) into a self-contained prompt, then call:

```bash
uv run python -m memory consult FAMILY TIER "SYNTHESIZED_PROMPT" \
  [--persona PERSONA] [--journey JOURNEY] [--org]
```

The synthesized prompt must be self-contained — the external LLM has no access to the conversation.

## Credits

```bash
uv run python -m memory consult credits
```

Shows OpenRouter usage and remaining balance.
