## Done

### 2026-04-29 — CV8.E1 complete: Gemini CLI spike — L4 full parity confirmed

Inspected Gemini CLI 0.38.2 (installed via Homebrew) against the Mirror Mind
runtime contract. All runtime questions answered in a single spike session.

**Hook system:** Full shell-hook lifecycle via `.gemini/settings.json`. Hooks
communicate over stdin/stdout JSON. Key events: `SessionStart`, `BeforeAgent`,
`AfterAgent`, `SessionEnd`. Every hook receives `session_id`,
`transcript_path`, `cwd`, and `timestamp` on stdin. `$GEMINI_SESSION_ID` is
also available as an env var — no stdin parsing needed for session identity.

**Session ID:** Stable UUID per session. Always present.

**Transcript:** Full JSON at `transcript_path` (`~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.json`).
Structure mirrors Claude Code: `messages[]` with `type: user | gemini`, full text content.
Per-turn assistant logging via `AfterAgent.prompt_response` is preferred over backfill.

**Mirror Mode injection:** `BeforeAgent` → `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` —
text appended to the prompt before model processing. Automatic per-turn injection
without requiring explicit user invocation. Cleaner than Pi, equivalent to Claude Code.

**Skills:** Native SKILL.md discovery at `.gemini/skills/` — same format as Pi.
Model activates on demand via `activate_skill`. Existing Pi skills are directly reusable.

**SessionEnd limitation:** Best-effort — CLI exits without waiting. Mitigated by
deferred extraction (same model as Pi, already battle-tested).

**Target parity: L4 Full Parity.** All five levels satisfied.

**Order inversion decision recorded:** Gemini CLI first, Codex second. Rationale
in `docs/project/decisions.md`. CV8 index and roadmap updated.

**Also: v0.4.0 released** — marks CV7 Intelligence Depth complete. 997 tests,
ruff clean, CI green.

### 2026-04-29 — CV7.E4 complete: Memory Depth (S4 — Shadow as structural cultivation)

Four pieces completing the shadow architecture decided in the 2026-04-26
therapist session.

**Shadow composition wiring:** `touches_shadow` now propagates from
reception through `_resolve_defaults()` → `load()` →
`load_mirror_context()` → identity service. The shadow layer composes
asymmetrically: only when `touches_shadow=True` AND `identity.shadow`
has content. Composition includes a provenance framing line.

**`propose_shadow_observations()`** in `intelligence/shadow.py`: scans
shadow-candidate memories (layer=shadow or type=tension/pattern,
readiness_state in observed/candidate), loads existing structural shadow
content for dedup, calls the LLM once with the full pool.
`SHADOW_SCAN_PROMPT` encodes: ground in evidence, don't duplicate
existing structural content, return [] when insufficient. Fail-open.

**`get_shadow_candidate_memories()`** added to `MemoryStore`: one query
for all shadow-candidate memories.

**Bug fixed:** `create_memory()` INSERT now explicitly sets `use_count`
and `readiness_state` from the model — previously always used DB defaults.

**mm-shadow CLI**: scan / apply / reject / list / show.
On apply: writes to `identity.shadow.profile`, sources → `acknowledged`,
provenance recorded in `consolidations` table (action=`shadow_observation`).

**Skills**: `mm-shadow` (Pi) and `mm:shadow` (Claude Code).

CV7.E4 fully done: S1 (hybrid search) + S2 (honest reinforcement) +
S3 (consolidation) + S4 (shadow). CV7 is complete.

997 tests pass. ruff clean. CI green on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

---

### 2026-04-29 — CV7.E4.S3 complete: Consolidation as integration

The move from "the mirror remembers" to "the mirror grows". Raw extracted
memories now have a path into structural identity content.

**Promotion mechanism decision** documented in `decisions.md`:
Manual-by-acknowledgment for S3. Scan is automatic; promotion requires
explicit acceptance. Auto-by-repetition deferred until real sessions
produce calibration data.

**`consolidations` table** (migration 010): tracks proposals with full
provenance — source memory IDs, LLM proposal, user decision, final content,
timestamps. Action types: `merge | identity_update | shadow_candidate`.

**`cluster_memories()`** in `intelligence/consolidate.py`: greedy
single-linkage clustering by cosine similarity. Skips terminal states;
returns clusters of ≥2, capped at 5 per cluster.

**`propose_consolidation()`**: LLM call producing a JSON proposal per
cluster. CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT encodes three-action taxonomy and selection
rules (prefer merge when uncertain). Fail-open on LLM failure.

**CLI** `python -m memory consolidate <scan|apply|reject|list>`:
- `scan`: cluster + proposals, print, persist as pending
- `apply <id> [--content]`: execute (identity update / merge / shadow
  candidate), advance readiness_states, record provenance
- `reject <id>`: mark rejected, leave memories unchanged
- `list [--status]`: consolidation history

**Readiness state transitions on acceptance:**
- merge: originals → `integrated`; merged memory created with embedding
- identity_update: sources → `acknowledged`; identity layer appended
- shadow_candidate: sources → `candidate` for mm-shadow pass (S4)

**Skills**: `mm-consolidate` (Pi) and `mm:consolidate` (Claude Code).

972 tests pass. ruff clean. CI green on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

### 2026-04-29 — CV7.E4.S2 complete: Honest reinforcement

Replaces the naive `log1p(access_count)/3` (no decay, no use/retrieval
distinction) with a two-signal honest formula.

**Three new columns on `memories`** (migration 009):
- `last_accessed_at TEXT` — cached when the memory was last retrieved;
  updated atomically in `log_access()` so decay needs no extra query.
- `use_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0` — incremented via `log_use()` when the
  model explicitly draws on a memory in a response. Separate from retrieval.
- `readiness_state TEXT DEFAULT 'observed'` — Jungian progression state
  for S3/S4 consolidation and shadow work. Infrastructure only in S2.

**`reinforcement_score(access_count, use_count, last_accessed_at)`** in
`search.py`: use_signal = min(1, use_count/5); retrieval_signal =
log1p(access_count)/3 * exp(-ln2 * days / DECAY_DAYS). Weights:
USE_WEIGHT=0.7, RETRIEVAL_WEIGHT=0.3, DECAY_DAYS=180. At half-life,
retrieval signal halves; after 2 years it's ~6%.

**`hybrid_score()`** now takes a pre-computed `reinforcement` float
instead of raw `access_count`. Caller computes via `reinforcement_score()`.

**`MemoryClient.log_use(memory_id)`** exposed for skill-layer callers
to mark explicit use (infrastructure; wiring to Mirror Mode skill in S4).

**Config knobs**: `MEMORY_REINFORCEMENT_DECAY_DAYS`,
`MEMORY_REINFORCEMENT_USE_WEIGHT`, `MEMORY_REINFORCEMENT_RETRIEVAL_WEIGHT`.

**`evals/retrieval.py`**: 10 deterministic probes documenting the scoring
behavioral contract. Free to run, no API calls. All 10 pass.

945 tests pass. ruff clean. CI green on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E4.S1 complete: Hybrid search 2.0

Adds FTS5 full-text lexical search as a new signal in the hybrid scorer and
MMR deduplication to suppress near-identical results from the ranked list.

**`memories_fts` FTS5 table** (`schema.py`, migration 008): external content
table referencing `memories` via rowid. Three triggers (`ai`, `ad`, `au`)
keep the FTS index in sync with every insert, update, and delete. Migration
skips on fresh databases (SCHEMA handles it); populates from existing rows
on existing databases. Migration 008 is idempotent.

**`fts_search(query, memory_type, layer, journey, limit)`** on `MemoryStore`:
converts the query to a safe FTS5 expression (per-word double-quoting avoids
operator injection), joins back to `memories` to apply structured filters,
returns `(memory_id, rank_score)` pairs where `rank_score = 1/(1+rank)`.
Degrades gracefully to `[]` on any `sqlite3.OperationalError`.

**Updated `SEARCH_WEIGHTS`** in `config.py`: added `lexical: 0.15`;
rebalanced to sum to 1.0 (semantic 0.50, recency 0.15, reinforcement 0.10,
relevance 0.10, lexical 0.15). Added `MMR_DEDUP_THRESHOLD = 0.92`.

**`mmr_dedupe(candidates, limit, threshold)`** in `search.py`: Maximal
Marginal Relevance pass. Iterates candidates in score order; suppresses any
candidate whose max cosine similarity to already-selected results meets or
exceeds threshold. Returns up to `limit` SearchResult values.

**Updated `MemorySearch.search()`**: FTS5 rank scores fetched once per
search call; added to the hybrid score via lexical weight; MMR dedup applied
before logging access and returning results.

917 tests pass. ruff clean.

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E3 complete: Extraction Quality

All four stories shipped. E3 is done.

**S4 — Generated descriptors (sidecar table)**

Adds routing-optimized 1-2 sentence descriptors for personas and journeys,
stored in a new `identity_descriptors` sidecar table keyed by `(layer, key)`.

`identity_descriptors` table: `(layer, key)` primary key, `descriptor TEXT`,
`generated_at TEXT`. Added to `schema.py` and `migrations.py` (007).

`IdentityDescriptor` dataclass in `models.py`. Storage methods on
`IdentityStore`: `upsert_descriptor`, `get_descriptor`, `get_descriptors_by_layer`
(the hot path: one query per layer returns `{key: descriptor}`).

`DESCRIPTOR_PROMPT` in `prompts.py`: adapts rules for persona vs journey;
150-char max; no meta-system references.

`generate_descriptor(content, layer, key, on_llm_call)` in `extraction.py`:
plain text output; returns `""` on empty content or LLM failure.

`mirror.py` reception: loads descriptors via `get_descriptors_by_layer` (one
query per layer before building the candidate list); uses descriptor when
present, falls back to `content[:200]` when absent. No flag needed.

`python -m memory descriptor generate [--layer L] [--key K]`: generates and
stores descriptors via LLM. Default: all personas + all journeys.
`python -m memory descriptor list [--layer L]`: shows stored descriptors.

Eval: `descriptor-quality` probe added to `evals/extraction.py` (10 total).
Tests: 7 unit tests for `generate_descriptor`; 6 storage contract tests in
`test_identity_descriptor.py`.

905 tests pass. ruff clean.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E3.S3 complete: Per-conversation summary

Replaces the naive message-concatenation stored in `Conversation.summary`
with an LLM-generated 3-4 sentence prose summary.

**`CONVERSATION_SUMMARY_PROMPT`** encodes four rules: open with the main
topic, include the key decision/insight if any, note emotional tone only
when clearly significant, standalone prose (no "we discussed").

**`generate_conversation_summary(messages, user_name, on_llm_call)`** in
`extraction.py`. Plain text output (not JSON). Returns `""` on empty
messages or LLM failure (fail safe).

**`MEMORY_SUMMARIZE=1`** feature flag. Default off. When enabled,
`_run_extraction()` calls the LLM summarizer; falls back to naive
concatenation on empty return. Naive concatenation extracted into private
`_naive_summary()` helper. Summary stored in `Conversation.summary`
(up to 1000 chars, up from 500) and used as the embedding input.

**`mm-recall`** now displays the summary when present, before the `---`
separator.

**Eval** -- `conversation-summary` probe added to `evals/extraction.py`
(9 probes total). Verifies: non-empty, 20-600 chars, on-topic (pricing
terminology), standalone (no "we discussed").

**Tests** -- 6 unit tests for `generate_conversation_summary()`: empty
messages short-circuit, LLM response returned, whitespace stripped,
LLM exception returns `""`, callback behavior.

892 tests pass. ruff clean.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E3.S2 complete: Two-pass extraction

Adds a curation pass that deduplicates candidate memories against the
user's existing memory pool before storing them.

**`curate_against_existing(candidates, existing, on_llm_call)`** — new
function in `extraction.py`. Storage-free: caller provides pre-fetched
existing memories. Returns a filtered/revised `list[ExtractedMemory]` in
the same shape as extraction output, so downstream code is unchanged.
Fail-open contract: on any LLM error or malformed JSON, returns candidates
unchanged (degrades to single-pass). Short-circuits with no LLM call when
`existing` is empty.

**`CURATION_PROMPT`** — static rules section in `prompts.py`. Encodes
three decisions: keep (genuine new signal), merge (extends existing),
drop (near-duplicate). Default to keep when uncertain.

**`MEMORY_TWO_PASS=1`** feature flag in `config.py`. Default off —
existing behavior completely unchanged when unset.

**Wired into `_run_extraction()`** in `conversation.py`. When enabled:
for each candidate, search existing memories (limit 3, same journey),
dedup by id (cap 15), call `curate_against_existing`. LLM call logged
with `role="curation"` when `MEMORY_LOG_LLM_CALLS=1`.

**Eval** — `two-pass-dedup` probe added to `evals/extraction.py`:
near-duplicate candidate dropped, novel candidate kept. 8 total probes,
threshold 0.80.

**Tests** — 8 unit tests for `curate_against_existing` covering: empty
candidates, empty existing (both short-circuit), valid curation, all
dropped, malformed JSON, LLM exception (last four: fail open), and
callback behavior.

886 tests pass. ruff clean.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E3.S1 complete: Extraction prompt revision

Rewrote `EXTRACTION_PROMPT` with four structural improvements over the
CV0-era prompt:

1. **Quality bar shift** — "prefer 0–3 memories of real signal over 5
   mediocre ones" replaces the vague upper bound that invited quota-filling
   with trivial observations.
2. **Explicit negative examples** — small talk, immediately-answered
   questions, technical details without insight, obvious facts, anything the
   user would not want to find in search six months from now.
3. **Shadow discipline rule** — `layer=shadow` now requires positive evidence
   of avoidance, contradiction, or circling. "When in doubt between ego and
   shadow, use ego."
4. **Standalone content rule** — each memory's `content` must make sense
   without the conversation; no pronouns without antecedents.

Eval updated: `tension-shadow` tightened to require `layer=shadow`;
`mixed-conversation` and `shadow-layer-discipline` probes added.

**New extraction baseline (7 probes, THRESHOLD=0.80): 7/7 PASS**

| Probe | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| engineering-decision | PASS | 2 memories (was 4) — fewer, higher signal |
| existential-reflection | PASS | 3 memories |
| tension-shadow | PASS | 1 memory, pattern/shadow (shadow discipline working) |
| trivial-no-memory | PASS | 0 memories |
| commitment | PASS | 3 memories |
| mixed-conversation | PASS | 1 memory, decision/ego (small talk suppressed) |
| shadow-layer-discipline | PASS | 1 memory, pattern/shadow |

874 tests pass.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E2 complete: Reception & Conditional Composition

All three stories shipped. Reception is now the canonical routing source
for persona and journey when `MEMORY_RECEPTION=1`.

**S1 — Reception MVP**
`reception()` in `src/memory/intelligence/reception.py` classifies each
Mirror Mode turn in one LLM call and returns four axes: `personas`,
`journey`, `touches_identity`, `touches_shadow`. Storage-free pattern,
`ReceptionResult.empty()` fallback on any failure. `MEMORY_RECEPTION=1`
feature flag. `evals/reception.py` added: 12 probes, baseline 10/12 (0.83)
PASS.

**S2 — Conditional composition**
`load_mirror_context()` accepts `touches_identity: bool = True`. When
`False`, `self/soul` and `ego/identity` are omitted — only `ego/behavior`
and `user/identity` load. Signal flows: reception → `_resolve_defaults()`
→ `load()` → `load_mirror_context()`. All existing callers unaffected
(default `True`).

**S3 — Reception as canonical routing source**
Restructured `_resolve_defaults()` so reception runs before sticky
defaults. Priority order: explicit args → reception → sticky fallback →
keyword/embedding detection. Reception can now override a session sticky
when the turn clearly belongs to a different persona.

874 tests pass.

---

### 2026-04-28 — CV7.E1 complete: Pipeline Observability & Evals

All five stories shipped. E1 baseline is established.

**S1 — `llm_calls` log table + instrumentation**
Every LLM call in the extraction pipeline now writes a structured row when
`MEMORY_LOG_LLM_CALLS=1`. `send_to_model()` captures latency and prompt.
Extraction refactored: prompts split to `prompts.py`, `ExtractedTask` moved
to `models.py`, `_parse_json_response()` eliminates 4x duplication, all four
functions route through `send_to_model()` with `on_llm_call` callbacks.

**S2 — Evals harness + extraction eval**
`evals/` framework established: `EvalProbe`, `EvalResult`, `EvalReport` types,
a runner with scored output and exit codes, and the first eval (`extraction`)
with 5 probes. `uv run python -m memory eval <name>` is a working command.

**S3 — Routing eval + proportionality eval**
Two more evals: `routing` (15 probes, persona detection behavioral contract)
and `proportionality` (5 probes, casual exchanges should produce 0 memories —
the watch probe for the expression pass).

**S4 — `inspect llm-calls` CLI**
`python -m memory inspect llm-calls` with filters by role, conversation,
session, since-date, and limit. Per-row trace with timestamp, model, token
counts, latency, and prompt/response snippets.

**S5 — Baseline measurement (this entry)**
All three evals run against production LLM. Scores recorded below.

---

#### E1 Baseline Scores (2026-04-28, model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite)

| Eval | Score | Threshold | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| `extraction` | 5/5 (1.00) | 0.80 | PASS | All five transcript probes produced correct memory shapes |
| `routing` | 13/15 (0.87) | 0.85 | PASS | Two misses documented below |
| `proportionality` | 5/5 (1.00) | 0.80 | PASS | Zero memories extracted for all casual exchanges |

**Routing misses (keyword routing — expected to improve with E2 LLM classifier):**
- `ambiguous-writing-over-research`: got `researcher` instead of `writer`. Query
  contains both "writing" and "research"; researcher wins on keyword density.
  E2's intent-based classifier should resolve this correctly.
- `null-open-question` ("what is the meaning of freedom"): got `scholar` instead
  of `None`. "meaning" is a routing keyword for scholar. Acceptable false
  positive for keyword matching; E2 should handle open existential questions
  as null.

**Proportionality signal:** Clean baseline — extraction correctly ignores
trivial exchanges. No signal for the expression pass; CV7 ships without it
as planned.

**Next step:** CV7.E2 — Reception & Conditional Composition. E1 baseline
serves as the regression net for all E2 behavioral changes.

---

### 2026-04-26 — CV7 promoted from Planned to Planning

CV7 (Intelligence Depth) has been moved from "named placeholder" to
structured planning. Produced:

- `docs/project/roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/draft-analysis.md` —
  comprehensive territorial analysis comparing the current Mirror Mind
  intelligence stack to Alisson's `mirror-mind` reconstruction and to the
  broader field of agent memory and pipelined response systems. Includes
  the success-metric framework (means vs ends, truth vs proxy,
  optimization vs envelope), the four-epic proposal, and explicit
  resolved decisions.
- Rewritten CV7 index with the four epics, done condition, sequencing,
  and resolved/parked decisions.
- Four epic indexes: CV7.E1 (Pipeline Observability & Evals), CV7.E2
  (Reception & Conditional Composition), CV7.E3 (Extraction Quality),
  CV7.E4 (Memory Depth: Search, Reinforcement, Shadow).
- Two architectural decisions recorded in `docs/project/decisions.md`:
  shadow as both structural layer and memory destination (resolved via
  Mirror Mode session with the therapist persona); expression pass /
  `mode` axis deferred from CV7 with explicit watch criterion.
- Roadmap index updated: CV7 status now "Planning".

Next step: detailed planning of CV7.E1.S1 (the `llm_calls` log table) as
the first concrete tracer bullet for the CV.

### 2026-04-26 — GitHub Actions prepared for Node.js 24

Updated the active CI workflow to use Node 24-compatible action versions:
`actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-python@v6`, and
`astral-sh/setup-uv@v8`. Removed the stale duplicate `test.yml` workflow that
still used the old pip-based dependency path and duplicated the active uv-based
workflow.

### 2026-04-26 — Focused storage component tests added

Added component-level characterization tests for the storage contracts that now
carry the persistence boundary: conversation read models, memory read models,
runtime session state, and identity metadata behavior. The tests intentionally
cover focused contract behavior rather than exhaustive CRUD duplication.

This completes the storage-refactor follow-up task. The storage layer is now
split into focused components, CLI code no longer reaches into raw SQL, simple
service read-model SQL lives in storage, and the most important storage
contracts have direct tests.

### 2026-04-26 — Service read-model SQL moved into storage

Moved the conversation and memory reporting SQL introduced during CLI cleanup
from services into their focused storage components. `ConversationService` and
`MemoryService` now expose domain/read-model methods while delegating raw SQL to
`ConversationStore` and `MemoryStore`.

Also routed conversation task-duplicate checks through `TaskService` instead of
calling task storage directly. The only remaining raw DB access in
`src/memory/services` is the explicit transaction in `RuntimeSessionService`,
which remains deferred as a separate transaction-boundary design decision.

### 2026-04-26 — Direct CLI SQL removed from memory reporting

Moved memory listing and memory-type count queries behind `MemoryService`.
Added the `MemorySummary` read model plus service tests for recent listing,
filters, and grouped counts. The `memories` CLI no longer executes SQL
directly.

This completes the direct CLI SQL cleanup for `src/memory/cli`: `rg
"store\\.conn" src/memory/cli` now returns no results.

### 2026-04-26 — Conversation CLI queries moved into service layer

Moved conversation recall and recent-conversation listing queries behind
`ConversationService`. Added the `ConversationSummary` read model plus service
methods for ID-prefix lookup and recent summaries with message counts. The
`recall` and `conversations` CLIs no longer execute SQL directly.

Remaining direct CLI SQL is now isolated to memory reporting in
`src/memory/cli/memories.py`.

### 2026-04-26 — Journey project path metadata moved into service layer

Moved journey `project_path` metadata access into `JourneyService` through
`get_project_path()` and `set_project_path()`. Builder Mode and the journey
`set-path` CLI now use the service instead of direct SQL against the identity
table, removing four direct `mem.store.conn` accesses from CLI code.

Added service and CLI regression tests for project path reads and updates. The
remaining direct CLI SQL is now limited to conversation recall/list reporting
and memory reporting.

### 2026-04-26 — Runtime session workflow moved into service layer

Extracted runtime session conversation binding from storage into
`RuntimeSessionService`. The conversation logger now calls
`mem.runtime_sessions.get_or_create_conversation(...)`, leaving
`RuntimeSessionStore` closer to pure runtime-session persistence.

Added focused service tests for creation, reuse, and stale binding replacement.
The remaining storage/service boundary debt is direct
`mem.store.conn.execute(...)` SQL usage in CLI modules.

### 2026-04-26 — Store split into focused storage components

Refactored `src/memory/storage/store.py` from a 700-line database god object into
a thin façade composed from focused storage components: conversations, runtime
sessions, messages, memories, identity, attachments, and tasks. The public
`Store` API remains unchanged, so services and CLI callers continue to work
without behavioral changes.

This is the first storage-layer cleanup pass. The remaining architectural debt
is to reduce direct `mem.store.conn.execute(...)` SQL usage in CLI modules.

### 2026-04-25 — CV6.E4 onboarding closed with meaningful starter identity

Audited CV6.E4 and found the remaining onboarding friction: fresh users seeded
placeholder `your-persona` / `your-journey` records, which made the documented
verification commands look broken or fake. Replaced those placeholders with
meaningful starter runtime assets: `writer`, `thinker`, `engineer`, and the
`personal-growth` journey.

Updated onboarding docs and template docs so the first seed now produces useful
personas, routing metadata, and a broadly applicable journey. The verification
flow now exercises real database-backed persona detection for writing, thinking,
and engineering queries. CV6.E4 and the overall CV6 roadmap are now marked done.

### 2026-04-22 — credits clarified and Pi repositioned as the preferred runtime

Updated `README.md` and `docs/getting-started.md` to make the project's lineage
explicit. The docs now clearly credit **Alisson Vale** and link to the original
`alissonvale/mirror-poc` repository as the source of the mirror concept and the
first implementation. They also credit **Henrique Bastos** and link to
`henriquebastos/mirror-mind` for the Pi direction that influenced the move
toward a more model-flexible runtime.

The user-facing positioning was also adjusted: Claude Code is now described as
the original harness and still-supported alternative, while Pi is presented as
the preferred runtime because it better supports a multi-model future. README
and getting-started instructions now introduce Pi first and Claude second.

Follow-up corrections aligned the public repository naming with
`viniciusteles/mirror` (no current-project `mirror-poc` references in docs) and
normalized Pi links to the agent package URL:
`https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent`.

---

### 2026-04-22 — onboarding and runtime command docs aligned with uv

Standardized current-facing docs and skill instructions around `uv run` as the
repo command boundary. Updated `docs/getting-started.md`, `README.md`,
`REFERENCE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/project/runtime-interface.md`, Claude/Pi
skill docs, and local Claude settings so project Python commands and tests run
through the locked uv environment instead of system Python.

Onboarding was also tightened: `docs/getting-started.md` now uses CLI-first
seeding (`uv run python -m memory seed`), adds stronger verification commands
for personas, journeys, persona metadata, and routing, and includes a compact
success checklist for new users. Seed guidance in runtime skills was corrected
to point at user-home identity files rather than repository-owned identity
artifacts.

Committed as `c11acde` (`Standardize uv-run docs and tighten onboarding verification`).
CI green on the push.

### 2026-04-20 — sqlite3 connection fd leak fixed in MemoryClient

**Symptom.** After the thread-safety fix, `test_concurrent_memory_client_open_on_fresh_db_is_safe` still failed intermittently with `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`, reliably on Vinícius's machine, never on the agent's. Same line (`sqlite3.connect`) every time. A retry-with-backoff guard made failures take 6 s instead of 0 s — the symptom was persistent, not a filesystem flicker.

**Root cause.** Python 3.14's `sqlite3.Connection` does not release its underlying OS file descriptors through refcount-based cleanup. Only explicit `close()` or process exit releases them. The concurrency test creates 32 × 5 = 160 short-lived `MemoryClient` instances with no explicit close, leaking ∼2 fds per client. On a machine where cyclic GC doesn't run often enough between iterations, the process hits `EMFILE` and SQLite reports `unable to open database file`.

**Fix.** Added explicit lifecycle management to `MemoryClient`:
- `close()` closes the SQLite connection. Idempotent.
- `__enter__` / `__exit__` so callers can use `with MemoryClient(...) as mem:`.
- `__del__` as a best-effort safety net for callers that forget to close.
The concurrency test now closes every client it opens. Verified: leaked fds drop to zero without `gc.collect()`, and the test suite runs green across 30+ consecutive invocations on both machines where the failure reproduced.

**Side fix.** `mirror_state.mark_injected` previously constructed two `MemoryClient` instances back-to-back for a single hook invocation (read + write), doubling bootstrap cost. Now reuses one client across both store calls.

**Lesson.** When a fix doesn't work, treat the new timing data as a diagnostic signal. A retry that slows failures from 0 s to 6 s tells you the error is *persistent*, not *transient* — so the hypothesis was wrong, and the retry is masking symptoms of the real cause. Step back and re-instrument rather than iterate on the wrong hypothesis.

624 tests passing. CI green on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

---

### 2026-04-20 — pip replaced with uv; thread-safety race fixed

**uv migration (full, with lock file).** Replaced `setup-python` + `pip install`
with `astral-sh/setup-uv` + `uv sync --frozen` in CI. Generated `uv.lock` and
committed it. New users now get a byte-identical environment on first clone.
README and `docs/getting-started.md` updated: uv added to prerequisites, pip
references removed, stale `mm:save` entries cleaned up.

**Thread-safety race in bootstrap lock fixed.** `fcntl.flock` is a
cross-process primitive and does not serialize threads within the same process.
Under 32 concurrent workers on Python 3.14 this caused
`sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` during bootstrap.
Fixed by adding a per-db-path `threading.Lock` as an inner layer inside
`_bootstrap_lock`. `flock` remains for cross-process safety; the thread lock
serializes concurrent threads within one process.

**`mm:save` and transcript export removed.** `mm:save` had no practical use
case with `SESSION_LOG_AUTOMATIC` enabled and was removed entirely. The automatic
JSONL→Markdown transcript export (`TRANSCRIPT_EXPORT_AUTOMATIC`) was also
removed. `backfill_assistant_messages` is preserved — it still runs at session
end to capture assistant turns in the DB.

624 tests passing. CI green on Python 3.10 and 3.12.

### 2026-04-20 — Session log feature and one-off migration tool removed

Two cleanups driven by real usage findings on Pi.

**Session log removed.** The feature was built assuming the AI would actively
edit a log file during the session — which Claude Code supports but Pi does not.
On Pi, every session produced an empty skeleton with a "session" placeholder topic
and no content. Removed entirely: `src/memory/cli/session_log.py`, config entries
`SESSION_LOG_AUTOMATIC` / `SESSION_LOG_DIR`, all skill step references in both
`.claude/` and `.pi/` skills, the `docs/session-logs/` tree, and associated tests.
Pi's native logging is the replacement. Historical session logs moved to Dropbox.

**`src/memory/tools/` removed.** The `identity_english_migration.py` one-off tool
served its purpose during CV0 English migration and had been dead weight since.
Deleted with its tests.

624 tests passing. CI green.

### 2026-04-19 — CV5 audit and follow-up fixes

Independent audit of the CV4 + CV5 implementation. Findings: the CV5.E2.S2
concurrent-startup regression test was flaky (~20% failure rate); `/mm:save`
was silently targeting the wrong transcript after CV5 removed the writers of
`CURRENT_SESSION_PATH`; `backfill_pi_sessions` ignored `mirror_home`; mirror
state CLIs silently no-op'd on missing `--session-id`; `mirror deactivate`
CLI was effectively dead; and several state-file config constants and one
helper module had become dead code.

Landed in six verified commits. Concurrency regression test now passes 50/50
under stress. `REFERENCE.md` now documents the `runtime_sessions` table and
the CV5 session model. Retroactive session log added for the original CV5
implementation plus a log for this audit session.



---

### 2026-04-19 — CV5 Multisession Safety complete

Replaced singleton runtime state with a SQLite-backed `runtime_sessions`
registry. Session ↔ conversation routing is now database-backed and covered by
concurrency regression tests; mirror mode state is session-scoped; stale-orphan
cleanup skips every active runtime session instead of one ambient session; and
Claude hook reinjection now passes explicit `session_id` through the safer
runtime path. Concurrent startup against a fresh database no longer trips
migration integrity failures.

### 2026-04-17 — CV0 English Foundation complete

Full Portuguese→English migration across all layers: Python API, CLI, runtime
config, schema, seed, hooks, skills, identity YAMLs, and docs. No Portuguese
runtime paths remain outside migration-only code. 519 tests passing. Isolated
smoke test validated.

Key outcome: a stable English foundation for CV1 Pi Runtime.

Reference: [CV0 English Foundation](../project/roadmap/cv0-english-foundation/index.md)

---

### 2026-04-17 — Pi adoption spike complete

Technical investigation of `~/dev/workspace/mirror-pi` (Henrique's project).
Key findings: do not port wholesale — it is pre-English-migration. Port the
interface ideas (Pi session lifecycle, `.pi/` skeleton, mirror-logger extension)
against the current English core.

Implementation sequence and risks documented.

Reference: [CV1 Pi Runtime](../project/roadmap/cv1-pi-runtime/index.md)

---

### 2026-04-17 — Docs scaffold complete

Documentation hierarchy created: index, getting-started, project briefing,
decisions, roadmap (CV0 retrospective + CV1 epics), product principles, process
guide, worklog, and two spike docs.

Adopted planning style from Alisson Vale's `mirror-mind` repo:
CV → Epic → Story with `plan.md` + `test-guide.md` per story, breadcrumbs,
status tables, and narrative worklog.

Reference: Mirror Mind documentation assessment (historical, source no longer in repo)

### 2026-04-17 — CV1.E1 Shared Command Core complete

Mirror skill logic extracted from `.claude/skills/mm:mirror/run.py` into
`src/memory/skills/mirror.py`. The Claude skill is now a thin display wrapper.
`python -m memory mirror <subcommand>` and `python -m memory conversation-logger <subcommand>`
added to the unified CLI.

532 tests passing. ruff, pyright, git diff --check all clean.

Reference: [CV1.E1 Shared Command Core](../project/roadmap/cv1-pi-runtime/cv1-e1-shared-command-core/index.md)

---

### 2026-04-17 — CV1.E3 Pi Session Lifecycle complete

Extended `conversation-logger` with full Pi session lifecycle support:
`--interface pi` flag on `log-user`/`log-assistant`, `session-start`
(unmute + stale orphan close + Pi JSONL backfill + pending extraction),
`close_stale_orphans`, and `backfill_pi_sessions`.

Extraction tracking added to `ConversationService` via `metadata.extracted`
JSON field — no schema migration needed. 549 tests passing.

Reference: [CV1.E3 Pi Session Lifecycle](../project/roadmap/cv1-pi-runtime/cv1-e3-pi-session-lifecycle/index.md)

---

### 2026-04-17 — CV1.E2 Pi Skill Surface complete

Added `.pi/` skeleton: `settings.json`, `mm-mirror` thin wrapper calling
`memory.skills.mirror.main()`, `SKILL.md` user guide, and `mirror-logger.ts`
extension ported from mirror-pi with English runtime names. Added
`session-end-pi` CLI command and `backup` route to `__main__.py`.

552 tests passing.

Reference: [CV1.E2 Pi Skill Surface](../project/roadmap/cv1-pi-runtime/cv1-e2-pi-skill-surface/index.md)

---

### 2026-04-17 — CV1.E4 Pi Operational Validation complete

End-to-end smoke test against isolated DB (`MEMORY_DIR=/tmp/cv1-e4`). Pi session
ran `/mm-mirror`, extension logged all turns via `mirror-logger.ts`, `session-start`
triggered extraction, 1 memory extracted from `journal=mirror` conversation.
Production DB untouched (confirmed by checksum). 0 ERROR lines in mirror-logger.log.

Fixed bug: `mirror-logger.ts` hardcoded `~/.mirror/` instead of reading
`MEMORY_DIR` from environment — corrected with `_resolveMemoryDir()`.

CV1 done condition met: dual-interface (Claude Code + Pi), shared Python core,
all four epics complete, 552 tests passing.

## Done

### 2026-04-29 — CV8.E2 complete: Gemini CLI runtime implementation

Four shell hooks + settings.json + 19 skill symlinks.

**Hooks** (`.gemini/hooks/`, registered in `.gemini/settings.json`):
- `session-start.sh` → `SessionStart`: `conversation-logger session-start`
- `log-user.sh` → `BeforeAgent`: `log-user --interface gemini_cli` + conditional
  `mirror load --context-only` returning identity block as `additionalContext`
- `log-assistant.sh` → `AfterAgent`: `log-assistant --interface gemini_cli`
- `session-end.sh` → `SessionEnd` (best-effort): `session-end-pi` + `backup --silent`

Session ID via `$GEMINI_SESSION_ID` env var — no stdin parsing needed.
Skill invocations (prompts starting with `/`) skip logging in `BeforeAgent`.

**Skills** (`.gemini/skills/mm-*/`): 19 symlinks pointing to `.pi/skills/mm-*/`.
Same SKILL.md format — one source of truth for both runtimes. Verified with
`gemini skills list` — all 19 discovered and enabled.

**No Python changes** — `interface` is a free-text field; `gemini_cli` passes
through unchanged. 997 tests still pass.

Runtime interface doc updated: Gemini CLI added as third runtime.

---

### 2026-04-29 — CV8.E3 complete: Gemini CLI operational validation

Smoke test, production DB safety proof, and public docs updated.

**Smoke test** (`scripts/smoke_gemini_cli.sh`): isolated DB (`DB_PATH` override),
simulates all four hook events, inspects `interface='gemini_cli'` rows, verifies
user and assistant message content, confirms production DB checksum is unchanged.
All checks pass.

**Session-start fix:** hook was printing the Python status line to stdout before
the JSON object, which violated Gemini's hook contract. Fixed to redirect all
Python output to `/dev/null`.

**Docs updated:**
- README: three runtimes, Gemini CLI in prerequisites, commands table now says
  "Pi / Gemini CLI", start-using section includes Gemini CLI
- Getting Started: three runtimes, prerequisites, Gemini CLI start section
- Runtime Interface Contract: Gemini CLI reference implementation table added
- mm-help skill: description updated to mention both Pi and Gemini CLI

**Final parity: L4 Full Parity.** All five levels satisfied. One honest limitation
(SessionEnd best-effort) documented and mitigated by deferred extraction.

---

### 2026-04-29 — CV8.E4 complete: Runtime Adapter Hardening

Seven lessons from the Gemini CLI integration extracted and hardened into
explicit contract language. No premature abstraction — each pattern is
backed by two concrete runtimes.

**L1 — Stdout purity (shell-hook runtimes):** stdout must contain only one JSON
object. Found live in Gemini CLI (status line leaking before JSON). Rule and
correct/wrong examples added to the contract.

**L2 — Session ID delivery:** three delivery models documented (Claude Code
stdin, Gemini CLI stdin+env var, Pi TypeScript context). Preference rule:
use env var when available.

**L3 — Two extraction models:** immediate (`session-end` + transcript) vs
deferred (`session-end-pi`). Tradeoff documented. Both proven in production.

**L4 — Three injection models:** automatic per-turn (Gemini CLI), hook-conditional
(Claude Code), explicit invocation (Pi). Tradeoffs and guidance for new runtimes.

**L5 — Smoke test isolation:** `DB_PATH` is the correct override; `MIRROR_HOME`
conflicts with `MIRROR_USER` from `.env`. Standard smoke test structure documented.

**L6 — Skill symlinks:** SKILL.md-native runtimes share skills via symlinks from
`.pi/skills/`. Zero maintenance — Pi skill updates propagate automatically.

**L7 — Interface label:** free-text field; no Python changes for new runtimes.

**Codex checklist** (`cv8-e5-codex-runtime-spike/codex-checklist.md`): every
known answer and every unknown to answer in the E5 spike. Target parity
prediction matrix included.

## Next

- **CV8.E5 (next):** Codex Runtime Spike — hook scripts, `settings.json`,
  `gemini_cli` interface label in Python, and `.gemini/skills/mm-*/SKILL.md` surface.
  See [CV8.E2 index](../project/roadmap/cv8-runtime-expansion/cv8-e2-gemini-cli-runtime-implementation/index.md).
- **CV8.E3:** Gemini CLI Operational Validation & Docs — smoke test, isolated DB, README/REFERENCE updates.
- **CV8.E4:** Runtime Adapter Hardening — fold Gemini CLI lessons into the runtime contract before Codex.
- **Follow-up: `MemoryClient` lifecycle sweep (parked).** `__del__` is now a safety net, but hot call sites still open one client per call. Two passes worth doing eventually:
  1. Apply the `mark_injected` pattern to the other `mirror_state.py` helpers (`_load_state`, `write_state`).
  2. Per-process `MemoryClient` cache keyed by `db_path` for library helpers in `hooks/` and `cli/conversation_logger.py`.
