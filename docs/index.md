# About these Docs

This documentation is organized around four questions: what Mirror Mind is as a product, how the project is being built, how we work, and how to operate the system. Use the sections below as a map into the product principles, runtime specs, roadmap, development process, and operational reference.

## Project

How we are building it and why.

- [Briefing](project/briefing.md) — foundational decisions (D1–D8), architecture premises, glossary
- [Decisions](project/decisions.md) — incremental decisions and open discussions
- [Roadmap](project/roadmap/index.md) — CV → Epic → Story hierarchy with status

Current state: **CV0 English Foundation ✅ · CV1 Pi Runtime ✅ · CV2 Runtime Portability ✅ · CV3 Pi Skill Parity ✅ · CV4 Framework/User Separation ✅ · CV5 Multisession Safety ✅ · CV6 Runtime Maturity ✅ · CV7 Intelligence Depth ✅ · CV8 Runtime Expansion ✅ · CV14 Stateful Extensions 🟢 Phase 1**

Runtime expansion result: **Gemini CLI first at L4 full parity; Codex second at L3 parity through the wrapper script, JSONL backfill, `AGENTS.md`, and `$mm-*` skill invocation.**

## Product

What Mirror Mind is and how it behaves.

- [Product index](product/index.md) — map of product documentation
- [Principles](product/principles.md) — product behavior principles
- [Envisioning](product/envisioning/index.md) — UoC model, lenses, Maestro framing, and coherence as product architecture
- [Specs](product/specs/index.md) — concrete product and runtime behavior specifications

## Process

How we work.

- [Development Guide](process/development-guide.md) — navigator/driver model, TDD, verification checklist
- [Engineering Principles](process/engineering-principles.md) — code, testing, and process guidelines
- [Worklog](process/worklog.md) — operational progress (what was done, what is next)
- [Troubleshooting](process/troubleshooting.md) — known bugs in the wild, their root causes, and the fixes that addressed them

## Reference

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) — prerequisites, installation, first session
- [REFERENCE.md](../REFERENCE.md) — command reference and configuration
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — system design, layers, schema, and runtime model
- [Python API](api.md) — programmatic interface for developers
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — routing, modes, and available skills
