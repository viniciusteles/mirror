# Architecture

System architecture for Mirror Mind. Written for contributors who want to add
a feature or fix a bug and need to understand how the system is organized
before touching code. If you want to integrate programmatically, see
[docs/api.md](api.md).

---

## 1. System Overview

Mirror Mind is a local-first memory and identity framework for agentic AI
runtimes. One Python core (`src/memory/`) handles all persistence, extraction,
search, and identity management. Multiple harness interfaces — Pi, Codex, Claude
Code, and Gemini CLI — connect to that core through thin adapter layers. The
database is SQLite, stored in the user's home directory. Nothing runs on a
server; all data stays on the user's machine.

---

## 2. Repository Structure

```text
src/memory/                  — Python package: all business logic
  cli/                       — CLI entry points (call services, no raw SQL)
  hooks/                     — Hook handlers (called by runtime lifecycle events)
  intelligence/              — LLM-powered extraction, search, routing
  services/                  — Domain services (the implementation layer)
  storage/                   — Persistence components (raw SQL lives here)
  skills/                    — Shared skill logic callable by any harness
templates/identity/          — Generic bootstrap templates shipped in the repo
examples/extensions/         — Reference extensions (e.g. review-copy)
tests/                       — Automated tests
.pi/skills/                  — Pi skill surface (SKILL.md files)
.claude/skills/              — Claude Code skill surface
.agents/skills/              — Shared Gemini CLI/Codex surface (symlinked from .pi/skills/)
scripts/                     — Shell utilities (smoke tests, Codex wrapper)
evals/                       — LLM behavioral evaluations (not in CI)
```

**User home (outside the repo):**

```text
~/.mirror/<user>/identity/   — real user-owned identity YAML files
~/.mirror/<user>/extensions/ — user-installed extensions
~/.mirror/<user>/memory.db   — runtime database (source of truth)
~/.mirror/<user>/backups/    — database backups
```

---

## 3. Layer Model — Import Direction

The architecture enforces a strict one-way import hierarchy:

```
cli / hooks
    ↓
services
    ↓
storage
    ↓
db (SQLite)
```

- `cli` and `hooks` import from `services`. They never execute SQL directly.
- `services` import from `storage`. They hold domain logic and orchestrate
  storage calls.
- `storage` imports from `db`. It owns all raw SQL; no SQL lives above this layer.
- `MemoryClient` (`src/memory/client.py`) is a façade: it wires the services
  together and exposes a single public surface for all callers.

Reversing this direction — e.g. a service importing from CLI, or storage
importing from services — is a design violation. When in doubt, push logic down.

The single documented exception: `RuntimeSessionService` still owns some
transaction-boundary SQL pending a separate architecture decision.

## 4. Identity Model

Identity is organized as Jungian layers. Each layer has a distinct purpose and
activation condition.

| Layer | Purpose | Stored as |
|---|---|---|
| `self` | Deep identity — worldview, soul, purpose. The unchanging core. | `identity` rows with `layer='self'` |
| `ego` | Operational identity — tone, behavior, postures, constraints. | `identity` rows with `layer='ego'` |
| `user` | User profile — name, background, context. | `identity` rows with `layer='user'` |
| `organization` | Organization identity, if applicable. | `identity` rows with `layer='organization'` |
| `persona` | Specialized domain lenses. Not separate agents — depth added by the ego. | `identity` rows with `layer='persona'` |
| `shadow` | Structural tensions and blind spots. Cultivated from memory patterns. | `identity` rows with `layer='shadow'` |
| `journey` | Journey identity — what it is, its current stage, why it matters. | `identity` rows with `layer='journey'` |
| `journey_path` | Living status document for a journey. Updated as things evolve. | `identity` rows with `layer='journey_path'` |

**User-home YAML → database flow:**

1. `memory init your-name` copies templates into `~/.mirror/your-name/identity/`
   and substitutes the user's name.
2. `memory seed` reads those YAML files and writes rows into the `identity` table.
3. At runtime, the mirror reads exclusively from the database — never from YAML
   files directly.
4. Editing identity after the first seed: use `uv run python -m memory identity
   edit <layer> <key>` or the equivalent skill. Do not edit YAMLs and re-seed
   unless you intend to reset.

**Live persona list:** `uv run python -m memory list personas --verbose`  
(The database is the source of truth; there is no authoritative static table.)

---

## 5. Memory Model

Memories are extracted from conversations automatically at session end, when a
journey is set and the conversation has at least four messages (the quality
guard, D7 in the briefing).

**Extraction pipeline:**

1. Conversation ends → `end_conversation(extract=True)` fires
2. Two-pass extraction: LLM generates candidates → curation pass deduplicates
   against existing memories
3. Embeddings generated for each memory
4. Memories stored in the `memories` table with layer, type, journey, and embedding

**Memory layers:**

| Layer | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `self` | Deep realizations about identity, purpose, values |
| `ego` | Operational decisions, strategy, day-to-day knowledge |
| `shadow` | Tensions, avoided themes, recurring blind spots |
| `persona` | Domain-specific operational knowledge |
| `journey` | Journey-specific insights and decisions |
| `journey_path` | Journey status updates |

**Memory types:** `decision`, `insight`, `idea`, `journal`, `tension`,
`learning`, `pattern`, `commitment`, `reflection`

**Hybrid search scoring:**

```
score = 0.50 * semantic_similarity   (cosine, text-embedding-3-small)
      + 0.15 * recency
      + 0.15 * lexical               (FTS5 BM25)
      + 0.10 * reinforcement         (use_count + retrieval decay)
      + 0.10 * manual_relevance
```

MMR deduplication is applied to the final ranked list to suppress near-identical
results.

## 6. Runtime Model

Four harnesses connect to Mirror Core through different adapter patterns.

| Harness | Parity | Adapter pattern | Session ID source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pi | L4 | TypeScript extension (`mirror-logger.ts`) calls Python CLI | Session file path |
| Gemini CLI | L4 | Shell hooks in `.gemini/hooks/` | `$GEMINI_SESSION_ID` env var |
| Codex | L3 | Wrapper script (`scripts/codex-mirror.sh`) + JSONL backfill | Session UUID in JSONL filename |
| Claude Code | L4 | Shell hooks in `.claude/hooks/` | Hook stdin payload |

**L4 (full parity):** session start, per-turn user logging, per-turn assistant
logging, mirror mode context injection, session end with extraction.

**L3 (wrapper parity):** session start via wrapper, JSONL backfill at session
end, no per-turn hooks.

Skills (`SKILL.md` files) are the primary way users invoke Mirror Mind
capabilities. Pi and Gemini CLI/Codex share the same skill files via symlinks:
`.pi/skills/` is the source; `.agents/skills/` symlinks to it.

injection models, see:

## 7. Database Schema

**Default location:** `~/.mirror/<user>/memory.db`

Set via `MIRROR_USER=<user>` (resolves to `~/.mirror/<user>`) or
`MIRROR_HOME=~/.mirror/<user>`. Override with `DB_PATH` when needed.

### Main Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `conversations` | Conversation sessions | `id`, `title`, `persona`, `journey`, `started_at`, `ended_at` |
| `messages` | Conversation messages | `id`, `conversation_id`, `role`, `content`, `created_at` |
| `memories` | Extracted or manual memories | `id`, `memory_type`, `layer`, `title`, `content`, `journey`, `embedding` |
| `identity` | Identity, personas, journeys, journey paths | `id`, `layer`, `key`, `content`, `version` |
| `attachments` | Journey knowledge base | `id`, `journey_id`, `name`, `content`, `embedding` |
| `tasks` | Tasks linked to journeys | `id`, `journey`, `title`, `status`, `due_date`, `scheduled_at`, `source` |
| `memory_access_log` | Reinforcement access log | `memory_id`, `accessed_at` |
| `conversation_embeddings` | Conversation summary embeddings | `conversation_id`, `summary_embedding` |
| `runtime_sessions` | Runtime session ↔ conversation registry | `session_id`, `conversation_id`, `interface`, `mirror_active`, `persona`, `journey`, `hook_injected`, `active`, `started_at`, `updated_at`, `closed_at` |
| `consolidations` | Memory consolidation proposals and decisions | `id`, `action`, `source_memory_ids`, `proposal`, `status`, `applied_content`, `created_at` |
| `identity_descriptors` | Routing-optimized descriptors for personas and journeys | `layer`, `key`, `descriptor`, `generated_at` |
| `llm_calls` | LLM call log for observability (when enabled) | `id`, `role`, `model`, `prompt`, `response`, `latency_ms`, `created_at` |

---

## 8. Runtime Session Model

The authoritative mapping between a runtime `session_id` and a `conversation_id`
lives in the `runtime_sessions` table (introduced in CV5 — Multisession Safety).

Mirror Mode state — `mirror_active`, `persona`, `journey`, `hook_injected` — is
stored per session row. Two simultaneous sessions under the same mirror home hold
independent state.

**Operational consequences:**

- **Concurrent sessions are safe.** One mirror home can host multiple runtime
  sessions at once. Session creation, stale-orphan cleanup, and mirror state
  updates are all routed by explicit `session_id`.
- **Hooks must pass `--session-id`.** Runtimes extract the session ID from the
  hook payload or environment. CLIs that change mirror state warn on stderr if
  `--session-id` is missing rather than silently no-op'ing.
- **No singleton files.** `current_session`, `mirror_state.json`, and
  `session_map.json` are gone. Their responsibilities moved into
  `runtime_sessions`. The only per-home flag file that remains is `mute`.
