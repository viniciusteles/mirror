# API Reference

This document specifies the contract between the mirror core and a
`command-skill` extension. The contract is composed of three things:

1. The shape of `skill.yaml`.
2. The shape of `extension.py`.
3. The `ExtensionAPI` object passed to `register(api)`.

Everything outside this contract is considered an internal detail of the core
and may change. Anything documented here is stable and changes only with a
deprecation cycle.

## 1. The manifest — `skill.yaml`

```yaml
# Required fields
id: <slug>                  # lowercase, dash-separated; must match folder name
name: <human name>
category: extension
kind: command-skill         # or prompt-skill (see authoring-guide.md)
summary: <one-line summary>

# Required for command-skill
table_prefix: ext_<id>_     # must equal "ext_" + id + "_"; enforced at install
entrypoint:
  module: extension         # filename without .py
  function: register        # default; can be omitted

# Required: at least one runtime entry
runtimes:
  pi:
    command_name: ext-<id>          # must start with "ext-"
    skill_file: SKILL.md
  claude:
    command_name: ext:<id>          # must start with "ext:"
    skill_file: SKILL.md
  # gemini, codex, etc. optional

# Optional: capabilities for Mirror Mode integration
mirror_context_providers:
  - id: <capability_id>             # lowercase, dash-separated, unique within extension
    description: <one-line description>
    suggested_personas: [<persona_id>, ...]  # hint only, never auto-binds

# Optional: declared CLI subcommands (informational; the runtime source of
# truth is what extension.py registers via api.register_cli)
cli:
  subcommands:
    - name: <subcommand>
      summary: <one-line>
```

### Validation rules

- `id` matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`.
- `table_prefix` equals `f"ext_{id.replace('-', '_')}_"`.
- `kind` is one of `prompt-skill`, `command-skill`.
- For `command-skill`: `entrypoint.module` must resolve to a `.py` file
  inside the extension folder.
- Each `runtimes.<name>.command_name` follows the runtime's convention
  (`ext:<...>` for Claude, `ext-<...>` for Pi).
- Each `mirror_context_providers[].id` is unique within the extension.

Manifests that fail validation are rejected at install time and at every
subsequent load.

## 2. The entrypoint — `extension.py`

```python
from memory.extensions.api import ExtensionAPI


def register(api: ExtensionAPI) -> None:
    """Called once per process when the extension is loaded.

    Use api to register CLI subcommands and Mirror Mode context providers.
    Do not perform expensive work here — registration only.
    """
    api.register_cli("accounts", _cmd_accounts)
    api.register_cli("runway",   _cmd_runway)
    api.register_mirror_context("financial_summary", _provide_financial_summary)


def _cmd_accounts(api: ExtensionAPI, args: list[str]) -> int:
    ...
    return 0  # exit code


def _provide_financial_summary(api: ExtensionAPI, ctx: "ContextRequest") -> str | None:
    ...
```

### Rules for `register`

- Must be idempotent (may be called more than once in a long-running test).
- Must not raise on missing user data (an empty extension is valid).
- Must not perform any DB writes.
- Must not make network calls.

### Rules for handlers

- CLI handlers receive `(api, args)` and return an `int` exit code.
- Context providers receive `(api, ContextRequest)` and return `str | None`.
- Exceptions in handlers are caught by the core; the handler is free to
  raise on user errors with informative messages.

## 3. The API — `ExtensionAPI`

```python
class ExtensionAPI:
    extension_id: str        # e.g. "finances"
    table_prefix: str        # e.g. "ext_finances_"

    # --- Database access ---

    db: sqlite3.Connection
    """Raw connection. Discouraged for writes; use execute() instead."""

    def execute(self, sql: str, params: tuple = ()) -> sqlite3.Cursor: ...
    """Run a write or read query. Write operations to tables outside
    table_prefix raise ExtensionPermissionError."""

    def read(self, sql: str, params: tuple = ()) -> sqlite3.Cursor: ...
    """Read-only query over any table. Raises if SQL contains a write."""

    def executemany(self, sql: str, seq: Iterable[tuple]) -> sqlite3.Cursor: ...
    """Bulk write. Same prefix rules as execute()."""

    def transaction(self) -> ContextManager[None]: ...
    """Context manager wrapping conn.commit/rollback. Nested calls reuse."""

    # --- Embeddings ---

    def embed(self, text: str) -> bytes: ...
    """Generate an embedding using the project's standard model
    (text-embedding-3-small). Returns bytes (np.float32) suitable for
    storing in a BLOB column."""

    def cosine(self, a: bytes, b: bytes) -> float: ...
    """Cosine similarity between two embedding blobs."""

    # --- LLM access ---

    def llm(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        *,
        family: str = "gemini",
        tier: str = "flash",
        json_mode: bool = False,
        system: str | None = None,
    ) -> str: ...
    """Send a prompt through the project's LLM router. Returns the text
    response. Costs are logged to the same place core LLM calls log."""

    # --- Registration ---

    def register_cli(
        self,
        subcommand: str,
        handler: Callable[["ExtensionAPI", list[str]], int],
        *,
        summary: str | None = None,
    ) -> None: ...

    def register_mirror_context(
        self,
        capability_id: str,
        provider: Callable[["ExtensionAPI", "ContextRequest"], str | None],
    ) -> None: ...
    """capability_id must be declared in skill.yaml under
    mirror_context_providers."""

    # --- Migrations ---

    def run_migrations(self, migrations_dir: Path) -> int: ...
    """Apply pending migrations. Returns count of newly applied files.
    Called automatically at install; can be re-run manually."""

    # --- Logging ---

    def log(self, level: str, msg: str, **fields: object) -> None: ...
    """Structured log. Routed to the same logger as core code."""
```

## ContextRequest

The object passed to Mirror Mode context providers:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ContextRequest:
    persona_id: str | None     # active persona, if any
    journey_id: str | None     # active journey, if any
    user: str                  # active user (from MIRROR_USER / config)
    query: str | None          # the user's query, when available
    binding_kind: str          # 'persona' | 'journey' | 'global'
    binding_target: str | None # the target_id that triggered this call
```

Providers may use any combination of these fields. They should never assume
all are populated; in particular, `query` and `journey_id` may be `None`.

## Errors

```python
class ExtensionError(Exception): ...
class ExtensionValidationError(ExtensionError): ...     # bad manifest
class ExtensionPermissionError(ExtensionError): ...     # write outside prefix
class ExtensionMigrationError(ExtensionError): ...      # SQL or checksum failure
class ExtensionLoadError(ExtensionError): ...           # import / register failure
```

All extension-related errors inherit from `ExtensionError`. The core catches
`ExtensionError` at the boundary and logs it; an extension can raise its own
subclasses and they will be treated uniformly.

## Versioning and stability

The API is versioned as `extension_api_version` and exposed at
`memory.extensions.api.VERSION`. Phase 1 ships `1.0`. Backward-incompatible
changes increment the major version and trigger a deprecation cycle of at
least one minor release.

Extensions may declare a minimum version in `skill.yaml`:

```yaml
requires:
  extension_api: ">=1.0,<2.0"
```

Installs against an incompatible core fail fast at validation.
