# Welcome Card

A short, state-aware message the mirror surfaces once when a runtime starts.
Replaces nothing essential — it is not a banner or a menu. It exists to make
the mirror feel **continuous** across sessions: when you open it, you should
sense that something already lives there.

The welcome is computed by the Python core and rendered by each runtime as a
single block. One source, four interfaces, one voice.

---

## Principles

1. **One unit, not many.** Welcome appears in one place per startup. Never
   duplicated between popup and footer, never split into a sequence of
   notifications.
2. **State, not decoration.** Content reflects the current state of the mirror
   (active journey, recent insight, recent conversation). Static banners are
   forbidden.
3. **Silence when there is no signal.** If the mirror has nothing meaningful
   to say, the welcome is empty and nothing renders. The command must be safe
   to call in any state.
4. **Local and cheap.** Welcome composition is pure SQLite reads. No LLM, no
   network, no embeddings. Must run in well under 100 ms on a warm database.
5. **First person.** The mirror speaks as the user. The closing invitation is
   not "How can I help you?" — it is `Where shall we begin?`.

---

## Anatomy

The welcome is **two lines** plus a closing invitation:

```
◇ Mirror · <user>
<N> journeys · <N> personas · <N> memories · <N> conversations · since <Month YYYY>

→ Where shall we begin?
```

| Line | When it appears | Source |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Header (`◇ Mirror · <user>`) | Always, if a Mirror home is resolvable | `resolve_mirror_home().name` |
| Stats | Always, when header renders | counts from the database |
| Invitation (`→ Where shall we begin?`) | Always, when header renders | constant |

If the header cannot be resolved (no `MIRROR_HOME`, no `MIRROR_USER`), the
welcome is empty. There is no other path to empty output — a fresh database
still shows the welcome, even when every counter is zero.

### Why stats and not narrative

An earlier iteration of the welcome showed the active journey and the last
insight from that journey. Useful as a signal, but it created a false
expectation: the welcome is rendered as a `ctx.ui.notify` popup and is **not
part of the conversation context the model receives**. A user reading `Last
insight: "X"` would naturally ask the assistant about X and get a confused
or hallucinated reply.

Stats fix this by removing the narrative content from the welcome. Numbers
do not invite conversation — they just convey scale, structure, and
longevity. To converse about state, the user activates Mirror Mode
(`/mm-mirror`) which loads identity and memories into the conversation
context properly.

### Stats

The stats line shows five values, always in this order, always separated by
` · `:

| Value | Computation |
|-------|-------------|
| `<N> journeys` | Active journeys: identity rows with `layer='journey'` whose content declares `Status: active`. Same source as `list_active_journeys()`. |
| `<N> personas` | Identity rows with `layer='persona'`. |
| `<N> memories` | `COUNT(*) FROM memories`. |
| `<N> conversations` | `COUNT(*) FROM conversations`. |
| `since <Month YYYY>` | `MIN(started_at) FROM conversations`, formatted as `since <abbrev-month> <year>`. When there are no conversations, render `since today`. |

Counts above 1000 use a thousands separator (`1,247 memories`). Counts
below that render bare (`5 journeys`). Values of zero render literally
(`0 memories`) — a fresh mirror should look new, not pretend not to be.

## Contract: `python -m memory welcome`

Prints the composed welcome to stdout and exits 0. Always exits 0 even when
no welcome is produced (empty output).

```
Usage: python -m memory welcome [--mirror-home PATH]
```

Behaviour:

- Reads the active Mirror home from `--mirror-home`, `MIRROR_HOME`, or
  `MIRROR_USER` (standard resolution).
- Emits an empty string if `MIRROR_WELCOME=off` is set.
- Emits an empty string if the Mirror home cannot be resolved.
- Otherwise composes the welcome per the rules above.

Stdout is the rendering. There is no JSON variant. Runtimes must not parse —
they just display the string verbatim.

---

## Runtime integration

Each runtime calls `python -m memory welcome` once at session start. The
display rules are:

| Runtime | Render | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Pi | `ctx.ui.notify(welcome, "info")` once if non-empty | Status bar shows `<user> · <Nj>` separately |
| Codex | `printf` to terminal once if non-empty | Same string |
| Gemini CLI | `printf` to terminal once if non-empty | Same string |
| Claude Code | `/mm:welcome` skill prints it on demand | No automatic injection |

Pi must not also notify the session-start summary string (logging status,
extraction counts) — that information stays in the footer status. The welcome
is the only popup.

---

## Skills

`/mm-welcome` (Pi, Gemini), `$mm-welcome` (Codex), `/mm:welcome` (Claude Code)
all invoke the same command. Useful when:

- `quietStartup: true` is on and the user wants to see the welcome
- The user wants a snapshot mid-session
- A new runtime starts and the welcome was missed
