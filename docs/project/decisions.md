## Completed Decisions

### Coherence is a Builder lifecycle capability, not a command-first flow

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Reference:** [Coherence product architecture](../product/envisioning/index.md), [Coherence runtime spec](../product/specs/coherence-runtime/index.md), [CV10 Coherence Engine](roadmap/cv10-coherence-engine/index.md)

Coherence will be integrated into the natural Builder lifecycle instead of
being exposed primarily as a command users must remember. The user experience
remains: activate Builder Mode for a journey. When coherence is enabled,
Builder runs a preflight against the journey's `project_path`, injects a UoC
summary into the Builder briefing, surfaces blocking gaps before implementation,
and refreshes coherence after meaningful changes.

This keeps the separation clear: Builder executes, coherence governs, lenses
provide opinion, and Mirror remembers.

### Maestro is the doing-first product frame over Mirror Core

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Reference:** [Coherence product architecture](../product/envisioning/index.md)

Maestro is not a separate runtime, not a competing Builder mode, and not a
standalone coherence engine. Maestro is the public product frame for a
software-development audience: Builder plus active software lenses plus the
coherence protocol, powered by Mirror Core.

Mirror remains the underlying architecture: identity, memory, journeys,
personas, attachments, and long-term continuity. Maestro attracts through doing;
Mirror reveals itself through use.

### Localization and audience modes are Mirror-wide surfaces

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Reference:** [CV11 Localization](roadmap/cv11-localization/index.md), [CV12 Audience Modes](roadmap/cv12-audience-modes/index.md)

Coherence exposed two surface concerns: language and audience mode. They are not
owned by the coherence engine. Localization and audience modes are Mirror-wide
capabilities.

Localization changes language, not semantics. Audience mode changes explanation
strategy, not truth. Coherence must stay compatible with both by separating
stable semantic ids from human-facing text, but full localization and audience
mode behavior are planned separately.

---

### `memory` remains the historical package namespace for Mirror Core

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Reference:** [CV13 Mirror Web Console](roadmap/cv13-mirror-web-console/index.md)

The Python package is still named `memory` for historical reasons, but it now
contains more than the memory subsystem. It is the current namespace for Mirror
Core and runtime interfaces, including skills, CLI dispatch, and the local web
console.

New modules may continue to live under `memory.*` until a future package rename
to `mirror` is intentionally planned. This avoids coupling the current Web
Console PR to a broad package rename.

---

### Mirror Web Console starts as a local read-only docs browser

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Reference:** [CV13 Mirror Web Console](roadmap/cv13-mirror-web-console/index.md), [CV13.E1 Docs Browser](roadmap/cv13-mirror-web-console/cv13-e1-docs-browser/index.md)

The Mirror Web Console will begin with a small, local-first, read-only slice:
browsing and rendering Markdown documentation. Broader capabilities such as
configuration inspection, identity/persona inspection, and editing workflows are
future epics.

The first implementation binds to `127.0.0.1`, reads only approved documentation
roots, rejects path traversal, and renders Markdown as HTML.

### CV8 runtime order inverted: Gemini CLI first, Codex second

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Reference:** [CV8 index](roadmap/cv8-runtime-expansion/index.md), [CV8.E1 Gemini CLI spike](roadmap/cv8-runtime-expansion/cv8-e1-gemini-cli-runtime-spike/index.md)

The original CV8 plan had Codex first (E1–E3), adapter hardening (E4), then
Gemini CLI second (E5–E7). The order was inverted because:

1. **Gemini CLI was already installed** (0.38.2 via Homebrew). The spike could
   happen immediately without any setup friction.
2. **The spike revealed L4 full parity**. Gemini CLI exposes a complete shell-hook
   lifecycle (`SessionStart`, `BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, `SessionEnd`), a stable
   session UUID via `$GEMINI_SESSION_ID`, transcript path in every hook's stdin,
   per-turn context injection via `BeforeAgent` `additionalContext`, and native
   SKILL.md discovery. The implemented project-local surface is now the shared
   `.agents/skills/` tree, because Gemini CLI can read it and a parallel
   `.gemini/skills/` tree conflicts — still satisfying every Mirror Mind runtime
   requirement.
3. **Gemini CLI's hook model is closer to Claude Code** than Pi is. This makes the
   Gemini CLI adapter a cleaner first test of the general runtime contract: it exercises
   the same shell-hook path Claude Code uses, proving the contract generalizes to a
   second shell-hook runtime without modification.
4. **Deferred extraction is already battle-tested** from Pi. `SessionEnd` is best-effort
   in Gemini CLI, but deferring extraction to the next `SessionStart` is the exact model
   Pi uses — no new mechanism needed.

Codex remains second. It benefits from the adapter hardening that Gemini CLI forces
before Codex work begins.

### Shadow is both a structural layer and a memory destination

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Reference:** [CV7 §5.5 of draft-analysis](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/draft-analysis.md), [CV7 index](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/index.md), [CV7.E4](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/cv7-e4-memory-depth/index.md)
**Source:** Mirror Mode session with the therapist persona (recorded
conversation, 2026-04-26)

In the Jungian frame, shadow is not a category of content; it is a region
of the psyche defined by its relationship to ego consciousness. The
architectural consequence:

- **Memory destination side** — raw shadow material (tensions, avoidances,
  contradictions, repeated emotional vocabulary) accumulates as extracted
  memories with `layer = shadow`. Already partly in our schema; extraction
  discipline (CV7.E3) sharpens what lands here.
- **Structural layer side** — a `shadow` layer in the `identity` table,
  peer to `self` and `ego`. Holds consolidated, ready-to-surface shadow
  observations. Composes into the prompt under its own conditions.
- **Consolidation as integration** — the bridge. Raw memories cluster,
  get reviewed, distilled into structural content; raw memories remain as
  provenance.

Readiness states (`observed → candidate → surfaced → acknowledged →
integrated`) live as a column on memories. Reception gains a
`touches_shadow` axis distinct from `touches_identity`. Composition is
asymmetric: shadow surfaces with provenance and only when evidence
supports it, never as a verdict.

The remaining sub-question — the promotion mechanism (auto by
repetition, manual by acknowledgment, or hybrid) — is parked for the
CV7.E4.S3 / E4.S4 planning pass.

---

### Expression pass and `mode` axis deferred from CV7

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Reference:** [CV7 §8.1 of draft-analysis](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/draft-analysis.md), [CV7.E2](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/cv7-e2-reception/index.md)

Reception in CV7.E2 ships with four axes (`personas, journey,
touches_identity, touches_shadow`), not five. The `mode` classification
(conversational / compositional / essayistic) and the post-generation
expression pass that Alisson built as the form-shaping mechanism in
`mirror-mind` CV1.E7.S1 are **deferred from CV7**.

**Rationale.** The expression pass solves *proportionality* — short
messages getting back essays, casual asks getting back lectures. We do
not have evidence yet that this is among our top complaints, and we do
not have the instrumentation to measure it honestly. Building the cure
before measuring the disease is the over-engineering CV7 is trying to
avoid.

**Watch criterion.** Once CV7.E1 lands, a *proportionality probe* gets
added to the eval harness: short, casual, lived-in messages with the
expectation that responses stay short and proportional. If responses
systematically over-shape (essays for one-line messages, lectures for
casual asks), the expression pass earns its way back into the roadmap as
a focused mini-CV or epic in CV8 with its own success criteria.

**Anti-trap.** "Stamp `mode` on the assistant message now, build the
expression pass later" is rejected. A mode stamp without a downstream
consumer is dead metadata. When we revisit, classification and
consumption come back together — or neither.

### Consolidation promotion mechanism: manual-by-acknowledgment for S3

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Reference:** [CV7.E4.S3](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/cv7-e4-memory-depth/index.md), [CV7 §5.4 and §6 of draft-analysis](roadmap/cv7-intelligence-depth/draft-analysis.md)
**Source:** Engineering planning pass — the E4 index and draft-analysis both flag this as the highest-leverage decision in CV7.

**Decision: manual-by-acknowledgment.**

The three options were:
- **Auto-by-repetition**: system automatically promotes a memory when access_count or use_count crosses a threshold
- **Manual-by-acknowledgment**: user reviews proposals and explicitly accepts, edits, or rejects
- **Hybrid**: auto-surface candidates, require explicit acknowledgment to promote

**Why manual-by-acknowledgment for S3:**

1. **We don't know what the promotion mechanism wants to be.** The draft-analysis says this explicitly. Auto-by-repetition needs calibration data we don't have: which threshold? which signals? Implementing auto before we have data from real consolidation sessions means tuning blind — the same anti-pattern CV7.E1 was designed to prevent.

2. **Consolidation is not memory hygiene; it is integration.** The Jungian frame matters here. Promoting a pattern into structural identity (or shadow) is a meaningful act — it changes how the mirror will respond to future conversations. That act deserves human judgment, at least until we understand the failure modes.

3. **Provenance is safer with explicit acknowledgment.** When a user accepts a proposal, they know what entered the structural layer and why. When the system auto-promotes, the user has no clear moment of ownership. Confusion about "why does the mirror believe X" is a high-cost failure.

**How it works in S3:**
- `mm-consolidate scan` clusters similar memories and calls an LLM to propose one of: merge, identity_update, or shadow_candidate
- Proposals are stored in the `consolidations` table with `status='pending'`
- User reviews each proposal in conversation and issues `mm-consolidate apply <id>` or `mm-consolidate reject <id>`
- On acceptance: identity is updated, source memories advance to `readiness_state='acknowledged'`, provenance is preserved
- On rejection: proposal is marked `rejected`, memories stay at their current state

**Hybrid deferred:** The hybrid approach (auto-surface + manual acknowledgment) is what S3 implements — scan is automatic, promotion is not. Full auto-by-repetition (skip the review loop) is a future extension once we have data from real sessions showing which proposals users consistently accept.

### English domain language is complete and tagged

**Date:** 2026-04-17  
**Commits:** `fb0bcf6` through `d425b52`

All runtime paths — Python API, CLI, schema, config, seed, hooks, skills,
identity YAMLs, and docs — use English names. The migration took 9 sessions and
~40 commits. Compatibility aliases and runtime fallbacks have been removed.
Migration-only support remains in database migrations and migration rehearsal
code to allow upgrading old databases.

### Pi adoption ports interface ideas from `mirror-pi`, not the old `memoria` core

**Date:** 2026-04-17  
**Reference:** [CV1 Pi Runtime](roadmap/cv1-pi-runtime/index.md)

The `~/dev/workspace/mirror-pi` spike (Henrique's project) is pre-English-migration
and still uses `memoria`, `travessia`, `.espelho`. It is useful as a working
spike — particularly the `.pi/extensions/mirror-logger.ts` pattern and the Pi
session lifecycle handling — but it should not be ported wholesale.

The right move: adapt the Pi interface ideas against the current English
`memory` core. `mirror` becomes dual-interface; `mirror-pi` is a reference,
not the source.

---

### `mirror` stays local-first; client-server is a future/parallel track

**Date:** 2026-04-17

Alisson's `mirror-mind` is a greenfield server version with bearer token auth
and a web interface. That is a valid and separate direction.

`mirror` is the mature local runtime. Making it model/runtime agnostic
(Pi support, CV1) does not require adding a server. Client-server remains a
future track or a parallel project — not a CV1 concern.

---

### Skill logic extraction is a prerequisite for Pi

**Date:** 2026-04-17  
**Reference:** Briefing D8

Pi skills cannot be thin wrappers until the shared `src/memory/skills/` modules
exist. CV1.E1 (Shared Command Core) must complete before CV1.E2 (Pi Skill
Surface) can begin. This sequencing is explicit in the CV1 roadmap.

---

### Documentation scaffold before Pi implementation

**Date:** 2026-04-17

Adopted the planning and documentation style from Alisson's `mirror-mind` repo.
The docs scaffold (index, briefing, decisions, roadmap, principles, process) is
created before writing any CV1 code. This gives every future story a place to
live: a plan, a test guide, and a verification moment — before a line of
implementation is written.

### Skill layer principle: Python/CLI owns DB; Agent owns filesystem; no run.py

**Date:** 2026-04-18  
**Reference:** CV3.E4 Skill Architecture Cleanup

Every skill in both runtimes (Claude Code and Pi) calls `python -m memory <command>` directly from SKILL.md. No `run.py` intermediary exists under `.claude/skills/` or `.pi/skills/`.

The principle: **Python/CLI owns** everything that touches the database — identity, memories, conversations, metadata. **The agent owns** conditional logic, multi-step workflows, and filesystem reading. A `run.py` is only justified if the logic cannot be expressed as a `python -m memory <command>` call — which has not been the case for any skill to date.

Before CV3.E4, skills accumulated `run.py` wrappers that duplicated CLI modules, mixed DB operations with filesystem traversal, and drifted from one another. CV3.E4 eliminated all 23 run.py files across both runtimes, extracted the remaining logic into canonical CLI modules (`cli/build.py`, `cli/journeys.py`, `cli/consult.py`), and moved banner/icon output into `memory.skills.mirror.main()`.

The `mm:build` hybrid illustrates the pattern: `python -m memory build load <slug>` does all DB work and emits `project_path` as its final output line; Claude Code then reads the docs directory natively using its file tools. Neither side duplicates the other's capability.

### CV4 direction: framework/user separation with user homes under `~/.mirror/<user>`

**Date:** 2026-04-18

The next roadmap capability after CV3 is **CV4 — Framework/User Separation**. Mirror Mind should evolve from a repo that contains one user's live identity into a reusable framework with user-owned homes outside the repo.

Target direction:
- the repository keeps only generic identity templates under `templates/identity/`
- real user identity lives under `~/.mirror/<user>/identity/`
- runtime state lives beside it in `~/.mirror/<user>/memory.db`
- default subdirectories `backups/` and `exports/` also live under the user home, but remain configurable to other locations
- legacy Portuguese-era assets (for example `memoria.db`) migrate into this user-home layout

This decision resolves the previously open `MIRROR_USER_DIR` discussion in principle. The implementation details still belong to CV4 planning and stories, but the architectural direction is now set: framework in the repo, real identity and runtime state in the user home.

`uv` is explicitly out of scope for CV4. It may be revisited later as a tooling improvement, but it is not part of the framework/user separation capability.

## Open Discussions

### Migration rehearsal — long-term status

**Status:** Open  
**Raised:** 2026-04-17

`src/memory/cli/migration_rehearsal.py` and its tests exist to allow safe dry-run
testing of database migrations. It was built during the English migration to
validate schema changes without touching production.

Question: should this stay permanently? Or should it be removed once the
English migration is clearly stable and the upgrade path for old databases is
no longer a concern?

**Why not urgent:** The cost of keeping it is low. The risk of removing it
prematurely is higher. Revisit when legacy database upgrade support is no longer
needed.

---

### User-home selection and runtime-state direction were finalized in CV4

**Date:** 2026-04-19

The CV4 implementation settled the operational details that were still open on
2026-04-18.

Final direction:
- the active user is selected explicitly via CLI override first, then
  `MIRROR_HOME`, then `MIRROR_USER`
- conflicting `MIRROR_HOME` and `MIRROR_USER` values fail hard
- user-scoped commands accept `--mirror-home` where explicit single-home
  targeting matters
- in production, both the default runtime database path and `MEMORY_DIR`-derived
  runtime-state files default under the resolved mirror home
- transcript export is user-scoped, outside the repo by default, and automatic
  export is opt-in through `TRANSCRIPT_EXPORT_AUTOMATIC`

This closes the earlier open discussion about user-home selection/profile
bootstrap details as a CV4 planning question. Future work may refine the UX,
but the architectural and operational direction is no longer open.

---

### CLI parsing consistency and future `argparse` adoption

**Status:** Open  
**Raised:** 2026-04-18

Several commands already use `argparse`, while some older entry points still
parse `sys.argv` directly. Long term, the CLI surface should be standardized on
`argparse` for consistency, clearer help text, safer option parsing, and easier
command evolution.

This is worth doing, but not as opportunistic churn during CV4 feature work.
Revisit it during a future CLI/tooling modernization pass. That pass may happen
near other tooling discussions (for example `uv`), but the decisions should not
be artificially coupled.
