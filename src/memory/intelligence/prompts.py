EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are the memory system for Mirror Mind, a Jungian mirror AI.

Extract memories worth carrying into future conversations. Quality over quantity.
Prefer 0-3 memories of real signal over 5 mediocre ones. Return [] for trivial exchanges.

## What to extract

A memory earns its place when:
- A meaningful decision was made and the reasoning matters for future reference
- A genuine insight or shift in understanding occurred
- A recurring pattern or tension was named or noticed
- A concrete commitment was made
- Something was learned that will change future behavior

## What NOT to extract

- Small talk, greetings, logistics, scheduling
- Questions that were immediately answered (the answer is the insight, if any)
- Technical details without accompanying insight or decision
- Statements of obvious fact
- Anything the user would not want to find in a search six months from now

## Memory types

- **decision**: A strategic or operational choice made with reasoning
- **insight**: A realization or shift in understanding that changes perspective
- **idea**: A proposal or concept flagged for future consideration
- **tension**: A psychological conflict, internal contradiction, or avoidance pattern
- **learning**: Something acquired — technical, relational, or about oneself
- **pattern**: A recurring behavior or dynamic that has been noticed
- **commitment**: A concrete action committed to, with or without a deadline
- **reflection**: A deliberate reflection on identity, values, or meaning

## Jungian layers — be precise

- **self**: Deep realizations about purpose, core values, or life meaning. Rare. Use sparingly.
- **ego**: Operational knowledge, strategic decisions, day-to-day learning. Most memories.
- **shadow**: Avoidances, contradictions, recurring blind spots, resistances.
  Requires explicit evidence — not just emotional content. Use shadow when:
  the user names an avoidance, describes circling the same issue, or acknowledges
  a contradiction or resistance. When in doubt between ego and shadow, use ego.

## Standalone content rule

Each memory's content must make sense without the conversation. A reader six months
from now must understand the memory from the content field alone. No pronouns without
antecedents. Do not reference “the conversation” or “we discussed.”

## Response format

Return ONLY a JSON array, no markdown:
[
  {
    "title": "concise title, max 10 words",
    "content": "standalone, self-contained content",
    "context": "one sentence: what prompted this memory",
    "memory_type": "decision|insight|idea|tension|learning|pattern|commitment|reflection",
    "layer": "self|ego|shadow",
    "tags": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],

## Jungian Layer Criteria
- **self**: Deep identity, purpose, core values, or meaning of life
- **ego**: Day-to-day operational state, practical frustrations, work/routine reflections
- **shadow**: Unresolved tensions, fears, repeating patterns, avoided themes, vulnerability

## Tag Rules
- 3 to 6 emotional or thematic tags for future search
- Use words that capture the feeling, not only the topic
- Examples: anxiety, gratitude, solitude, clarity, exhaustion, purpose, fear, hope

RECEPTION_PROMPT = """You are the reception classifier for Mirror Mind, a Jungian mirror AI.

Your job is to classify a single user message on four axes so the mirror can
compose the right context for its response. Read the message carefully, then
return a JSON object — nothing else.

## Available personas
{personas}

## Active journeys
{journeys}

## Classification rules

**personas** (array of slugs, ordered most-to-least relevant, or [] if none apply)
- Return the personas whose domain clearly covers this message.
- Action verbs dominate topic: "write a post about X" → writer, not the X-domain persona.
- When a single persona's domain covers the message, return only that one.
- When genuinely ambiguous, return the most relevant one only.
- Return [] when the ego should answer alone (open questions, general curiosity,
  meta questions about the mirror itself).

**journey** (slug string or null)
- Return the slug whose description best matches the context of this message.
- Conservative: prefer null over a speculative match.
- Return null if no journey is clearly relevant.

**touches_identity** (boolean)
- true ONLY when the message explicitly invites reflection on personal values,
  life purpose, meaning, or deep self-examination.
- Operational and technical questions are false even if they involve important decisions.
- Default false. The cost of missing a touch is a lighter context load;
  the cost of over-triggering is token waste on every routine turn.

**touches_shadow** (boolean)
- true ONLY when there is explicit evidence of avoidance, internal contradiction,
  or a recurring pattern the user is naming or circling around.
- Requires positive signal. Vague discomfort or uncertainty alone is false.
- Default false. Conservative by design.

## Response format
Return ONLY a JSON object, no markdown:
{{
  "personas": ["slug", ...],
  "journey": "slug" or null,
  "touches_identity": true or false,
  "touches_shadow": true or false
}}

DESCRIPTOR_PROMPT = """You are generating a routing descriptor for Mirror Mind.

A routing descriptor is 1-2 sentences that tell a classifier exactly when to
activate this entity. It must be written for routing accuracy, not for depth
or voice.

## Rules

- For a **persona**: name the action domains and task types this persona handles.
  Lead with verbs and domains. Example: "Handles code review, architecture
  decisions, debugging, and software engineering tasks."
- For a **journey**: name what the journey is about and when a user's message
  is in scope. Example: "Active work on the Mirror Mind infrastructure —
  Python backend, memory system, skills, and identity architecture."
- Maximum 150 characters. One or two sentences. Plain text only.
- Do not mention Mirror Mind, AI, or meta-system references.
- Do not start with the entity name or slug.

CONVERSATION_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are the memory system for Mirror Mind, a Jungian mirror AI.

## Rules

- Open with the main topic or question the conversation addressed.
- Include the key decision, insight, or commitment reached, if any.
- Note emotional tone or psychological layer only when clearly present and significant.
- Standalone: a reader six months from now must understand what happened from the
  summary alone. Do not write "we discussed", "the user said", or "the conversation".

CURATION_PROMPT = """You are the memory curation system for Mirror Mind, a Jungian mirror AI.

You have just extracted candidate memories from a conversation. Your job is to
deduplicate them against the user's existing memory pool and decide what to
actually store.

## Decision rules

For each candidate, decide:

**keep** — The candidate contains genuine new signal not present in existing
memories. Include it unchanged.

**merge** — The candidate meaningfully extends or refines an existing memory.
Synthesize a combined version: use the candidate's structure but incorporate
the additional nuance. Include the merged version once.

**drop** — The candidate is a near-duplicate, restatement, or weaker version
of an existing memory. Omit it entirely.

Default to **keep** when uncertain. Only drop on clear overlap. Merge only
when the synthesis is strictly better than either alone. Never invent content
not present in the candidates or existing memories.

## Response format

Return ONLY a JSON array in the same format as the extraction output.
Omit dropped candidates entirely. Merged candidates appear as a single entry.
If all candidates are duplicates, return: []

1. **due_date** (required): Resolve ALL relative time references to absolute dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - "today" -> {today}
   - "tomorrow" -> the next day
   - "Friday" -> the next Friday from today
   - etc.

2. **scheduled_at**: Use ONLY when an exact time is mentioned, such as "at 7pm" or "15:00".
   Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM. DO NOT INVENT TIMES.

3. **time_hint**: Use for vague time references such as "late afternoon", "during the day", "morning", or "afternoon".
   If scheduled_at is present, time_hint is null.

4. **journey**: Associate the most likely active journey slug using the list above.
   If there is no clear match, use null.

5. **title**: Short and actionable. If the item is tentative, include "(tentative)" in the title.

6. **context**: Brief context note extracted from the original text.

CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = """You are reviewing a cluster of semantically related memories
extracted from {user_name}'s conversations. Your task: propose one consolidation action.

## Current identity context (for reference when proposing updates)
{identity_context}

## Memory cluster
{cluster_text}

## Three possible actions

**MERGE** — the memories overlap significantly (same fact, same decision, same insight
stated multiple times). Propose a single sharper memory that distills the key signal
without losing nuance. The merged memory replaces all source memories in scoring; the
originals remain as provenance.

**IDENTITY_UPDATE** — the pattern across these memories is significant and stable enough
to update the structural identity. Propose specific text to add to or revise in an
identity layer. Be surgical: propose the exact paragraph or sentence to insert or replace,
not a full rewrite. Requires ≥3 memories showing the same pattern.

**SHADOW_CANDIDATE** — the memories reveal a tension, avoidance, or contradiction pattern
that the user may not be fully aware of. This is raw shadow material, not ready to surface
yet — propose a concise candidate observation with supporting evidence. It will be reviewed
again in the mm-shadow pass before surfacing.

## Output format (strict JSON, no markdown fencing)
{{
  "action": "merge" | "identity_update" | "shadow_candidate",

  "proposed_content": "<the exact content to write>",
  "rationale": "<one sentence: why this action rather than the alternatives>"

## Action selection rules
- Prefer MERGE when memories restate the same insight (lower stakes, always safe)
- Use IDENTITY_UPDATE only when ≥3 memories show a clear, persistent pattern worth encoding
- Use SHADOW_CANDIDATE only for genuine tension/avoidance patterns — not every negative memory
- When uncertain between MERGE and IDENTITY_UPDATE, choose MERGE
- target_layer and target_key must be non-null only for IDENTITY_UPDATE
