# Journey

Use `/mm:journey` or `/mm:journey reflexo` to inspect journey status.

## 1. Load Status

```bash
python -m memory journey [JOURNEY]
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` was passed, use it as the journey name. Otherwise the script loads all journeys.

The script prints identity, journey path, recent memories, and recent conversations for each journey.

## 2. Synthesize

Combine the script output into a clear view of current progress.

## 3. Suggest Updates

If the journey path appears outdated relative to recent conversations and memories, suggest an update. After user confirmation:

```bash
python -m memory journey update JOURNEY "UPDATED_CONTENT"
```

For long content, use stdin:

```bash
echo "CONTENT" | python -m memory journey update JOURNEY -
```
