# Conversations

When receiving `/mm:conversations`, run:

```bash
python -m memory conversations [--limit N] [--journey ID] [--persona ID]
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a filter such as a journey slug, use it as `--journey`.

Present the result to the user. Mention that `/mm:recall <id>` loads a conversation.
